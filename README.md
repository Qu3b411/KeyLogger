# KeyLogger version 0.0.1 DEVELOPMENT patch incompleate

# Developed and tested on the windows platform.
# This is just the beging of the KeyLogger release, I havent had alot of time to develop it further, by releasing it I hope it will be picked up by some interested developers. 

# when I get around to it i plan to release an uppdate to document the code.
# so far it is only a demo mock up with limited capabilities. 
# At some point I plan to add socket level comunication, as well as a masive restructure. This is code I wrote many years ago and I havent been able to work on it since.
# At some point I plan to  add a means to grab the clipboard. Since the release of windows 10 the functionality of the clipboard has failed thus i cut that code out for the release. 
# please review it and let me know what Isues arise.
