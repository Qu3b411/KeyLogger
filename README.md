# Developed and tested on the windows 10.
# This is just the beging of the KeyLogger release, I havent had alot of time to develop it further, by releasing it I hope it will be picked up by some interested developers.

# please review it and let me know what Isues arise. 

# Known Issue
 1.) output is to the console and has not been changed as of yet.
 2.) special characters in process's will create malformated xml output that cannot be styled
 3.) an end </KeyLoggerMetaData> must be manually added as of this moment
