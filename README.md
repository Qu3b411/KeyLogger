# KeyLogger version 0.0.1 DEVELOPMENT patch incompleate

# Developed and tested on the windows platform, 
# This is just the beging of the KeyLogger release, I havent had alot of time to develop it further, by releasing it I hope it will be picked up by some interested developers. the framewor that has been layed out is sterdy, but my next update will be to document the code, so far it is only a demo mock up with limited capabilities. 

# At some point I plan to add socket level comunication, as well as a masive restructure. This is code I wrote many years ago and I havent been able to work on it since.

# At some point I plan to  add a means to grab the clipboard. Since the release of windows 10 the functionality of the clipboard has failed thus i cut that code out for the release. 

# please review it and let me know what Isues arise.
