# Contribuing is heavily encoraged!

I am hopeing to build an open and honest comunity built through heavy documentation, a clear direction, and a roadmap by which we can get their,

# their are many ways to meaningfully contribute

1) bug fixes are extreamly important, if their is indeed a bug, open an issue as layed out by .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md this is greatly appreciated and we will look into possible solutions as soon as possible

before issueing a bug report please check and see if a pull is allready open

2) Adrdress a problem in the TODO section, it is hard for me to be everywhere. but with an active community we can realy enhance tbe functionality of a the keylogger software.

3) if your up to the challenge, start working towards compleating a roadmap goal. 


# before a pull is accepted
1.) it must be able to be build useing gcc, 

2.) all work must be documented so that anyone can see what is hapening,

3.) variables and function names must be descriptive.
